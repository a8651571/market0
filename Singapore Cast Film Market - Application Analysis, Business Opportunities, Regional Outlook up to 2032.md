Cast film, a non-stretch, non-oriented cast film produced by melt flow quenching. There are two ways: single-layer flow and multi-layer co-extrusion flow. Unlike the blown film process, the cooling of the film with cast extrusion is highly efficient.
Cast film production involves a different process. In this case the resin is extruded through a linear die and oozes out onto large diameter chilling rollers. (Note that they may not actually be cold, but rather are much cooler than the semi-molten plastic.) Depending on the original thickness of extrusion, sometimes film is thinned to the target gauge by winding the resulting film faster than it is extruded.
